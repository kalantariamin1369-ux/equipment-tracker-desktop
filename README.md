## Development

### Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: Windows Forms UI (`MainForm.cs`)
- **Business Logic**: Equipment management logic
- **Data Access Layer**: SQLite repository (`EquipmentRepository.cs`)
- **Data Models**: Entity classes (`Models.cs`)
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and settings

### Key Components

- **EquipmentRepository**: Handles all database operations
- **Equipment/Transaction Models**: Data entities with property change notification
- **MainForm**: Tabbed interface with equipment grid and transaction history
- **Settings**: Theme and configuration management
- **Utilities**: Logging, CSV operations, file handling

### Building

```bash
# Command line build
msbuild EquipmentTracker.sln /p:Configuration=Release

# Or use the provided build script
build.bat
```

### Testing

The application includes comprehensive error handling and logging:

- Check `Logs/` folder for error logs
- Database operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- UI operations validate input data
- Graceful degradation for missing dependencies
